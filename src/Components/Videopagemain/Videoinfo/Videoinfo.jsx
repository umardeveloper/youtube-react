            A successful marketing plan relies heavily on the pulling-power of
            advertising copy. Writing result-oriented ad copy is difficult, as
            it must appeal to, entice, and convince consumers to take action.
            There is no magic formula to write perfect ad copy; it is based on a
            number of factors, including ad placement, demographic, even the
            consumerâ€™s mood when they see your ad.
